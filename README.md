# Unraveling Human Behavior: Insights from the Ultimatum Game

This project explores decision-making dynamics and behavioral economics through the Ultimatum Game — a classic game-theory experiment. The analysis sheds light on how fairness, self-interest, and strategic reasoning influence human offers and acceptances.

The broader goals of the study are to:
* Test the classical economics assumptions of selfishness
* Create and fine statistical models for inference and prediction
