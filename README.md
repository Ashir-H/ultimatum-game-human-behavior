# Unraveling Human Behavior: Insights from the Ultimatum Game
November 2023
This project explores decision-making dynamics and behavioral economics through the Ultimatum Game — a classic game-theory experiment. The analysis sheds light on how fairness, self-interest, and strategic reasoning influence human offers and acceptances.

The broader goals of the study are to:
* Test the classical economics assumptions of selfishness, self-regardness, and calssical rationality
* Create and fine tune statistical models for inference and prediction

## ⚙️ Experimental Setup

- Simulates the Ultimatum game setup
- Sample: Students of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) across disciplines and batches
- Participants are randomly and anonamously divided into Proposers or Responders.
- Players play 3 rounds in the same pairing.
- In each round, the proposer receives 100 points.
- Proposer makes an offer (in increments of 10) of points to share with the responder.
- The responder may choose to accept the offer and points are split accordingly, or reject it in which case neither of them receive anything.
- Tasked to maximize total points.

## 🕵 Problem Statement
- Classical Economics and Game Theory predict that rational responders should never reject,
- or accept as long as *anything* is offered.
- In reality: On average, offers below 40% are rejected.
- Behavioral Economic suggests expanding the model to include behavioral effects.

## 🔍 Summary

- Investigates proposer and responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game
- Visualizes offer distributions and acceptance probabilities
- Applies data exploration and behavioral interpretation
- Conducts inference and statistical testing with classical economics assumptions as null hypothesis
- Finds significant evidence of generosity even through a veil of anonimity
- Also finds siginificant evidence against self-regarding behavior
- Consistent results with previous behavioral studies and theories

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📈 Sample Visualization - Distribution of Offers

## 💡 Future Directions

- Incorporate financial and cultural demographics (if available)
- Simulate optimal strategies under different utility assumptions
